Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning
- Uses labeled training data
- Common algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM
- Applications: Classification, Regression
- Examples: Email spam detection, Price prediction

2. Unsupervised Learning
- Uses unlabeled data to find patterns
- Common algorithms: K-means clustering, PCA, DBSCAN
- Applications: Customer segmentation, Anomaly detection
- Examples: Market basket analysis, Data compression

3. Reinforcement Learning
- Learns through interaction with environment
- Uses rewards and penalties
- Common algorithms: Q-learning, Policy Gradient
- Applications: Game playing, Robotics, Trading

Key Concepts:
- Feature Engineering: Selecting and transforming input variables
- Cross-validation: Technique to assess model performance
- Overfitting: When model performs well on training but poorly on new data
- Bias-Variance Tradeoff: Balance between model complexity and generalization

Data Preprocessing:
- Handle missing values
- Normalize or standardize features
- Encode categorical variables
- Split data into train/validation/test sets
